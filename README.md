# cuPC
cuPC is a CUDA-based parallel implementation of PC-stable algorithm for causal structure learning on GPU. The main highlights of cuPC are as follows:
* Easy usage.
* Compatible with [pcalg](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcalg/index.html) software.
* 100X to 10,000X speedup compared to serial implementation on CPU.

#### Abstract
The main goal in many fields in the empirical sciences is to discover causal relationships among a set of variables from observational data. PC algorithm is one of the promising solutions to learn underlying causal structure by performing a number of conditional independence tests. In this paper, we propose a novel GPU-based parallel algorithm, called cuPC, to execute an order-independent version of PC. The proposed solution has two variants, cuPC-E and cuPC-S, which parallelize PC in two different ways for multivariate normal distribution. Experimental results show the scalability of the proposed algorithms with respect to the number of variables, the number of samples, and different graph densities. For instance, in one of the most challenging datasets, the runtime is reduced from more than 11 hours to about 4 seconds. On average, cuPC-E and cuPC-S achieve 500 X and 1300 X speedup, respectively, compared to serial implementation on CPU.
